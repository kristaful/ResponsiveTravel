      <h2>Fork Etiquette</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the world's largest fork, standing 35 feet, made of polished stainless steel, and signifying the home of The Food Channel. Please enjoy it and be safe, but stay on the concrete. Hashtag your photos <strong>#worldslargestfork</strong></p>

      <p>This roadside attraction is fun for the whole family. It is tucked behind a local business, but once you turn around the corner you're confronted with a most amazing sight. It will definitely make the trip worth it. Get a fork full of what others have to say!

          If you've been looking for the best selfie opportunity Missouri has to give, look no further than the World's Largest Fork. With this 11 ton fork sticking proudly out of the ground, there's no better background!

          It's really the most ridiculous thing. Why is it just standing there, stuck in the ground? It's in front of an office building, but that didn't deter me from spending 30 minutes in awe of this statue. It really makes you question things, you know?

        <blockquote>
          We were visiting Branson when someone told me about the World's Largest Fork not even an hour away. Immediately I loaded up the kids and made our way to Springfield. It was a little tough to find as it's hidden behind a business, but once we got there it was totally worth it. The kids thought it was hilarious. A great photo-op!
